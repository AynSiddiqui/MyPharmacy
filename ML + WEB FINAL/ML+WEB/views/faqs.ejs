These similarities help to demonstrate bioequivalence, which means that a generic medicine works in the same way and provides the same clinical benefit as the brand-name medicine. In other words, you can take a generic medicine as an equal substitute for its brand-name counterpart.

For generic medicine manufacturing, expenses related to patent and exclusive rights like brand-name non-generic medicine are not needed. Therefore generic medicines are priced at a lower amount,

                                            <p class="faq-title" >Generic medicines cost less but are not less effective. Makers of these medicines do not spend money on the development, research, animal and human clinical trials, marketing and advertising. A non-generic medicine with an expired patent can apply for a license to sell generic medicine, which is evaluated and approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation only if it meets safety and quality standards. 
                                                Generic medicine contains the same active ingredient that had undergone all clinical trials and quality testing during its patent when it was manufactured by a brand as the non-generic medicine. Therefore, these are considered to be safe. Pharmacovigilance centers monitor the safety and side effects of medications. They ensure consumers are getting effective and safe medicines. They also investigate problem reports and make recommendations to manufacturers, healthcare professionals and the public.
